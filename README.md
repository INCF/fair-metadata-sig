# INCF FAIR Metadata Special Interest Group

The broad implementation of FAIR Data Principles requires that researchers have appropriate tools and best practice guidelines in order to ensure the data are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. FAIR is being endorsed by many funding bodies and are being incorporated into future data sharing recommendations and programs. A critical foundation for the implementation of FAIR is the appropriate documentation of the data elements themselves to ensure that the underlying data elements are described with sufficient metadata (F), the description of data elements are openly available for humans and machines (A), data elements are using agreed upon definitions of common data elements (I) that are aligned to community standards (R).   To that end, a working group was formed during the Interoperability of Cyberinfrastructure Workshop hosted by McGill University in March 2018. This repository is meant for the working group's documents.
